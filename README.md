## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS DOM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Starting absolutely with fetching data from JSON file, first time to do that honestly(it felt awesome!).
- I also learnt way too more about making a dynamic products cart
  it wasn't easy considering all scenarios that might occur, but it was really a good and funny way to improve my logic.
- And it was an opportunity to learn how to write arranged and clean functions.

### Continued development

What I really want to focus more on now, is forsure JavaScript.
The way that I've seen it manipulating the page fascinated me,
so now I am even more eager to descover more and more concepts and features.
And continue learning and gaining more experience.

### Useful resources

- (Stack Overflow) I can't remember how many times I went there looking for answers and ended up with extra ideas and alternative solutions, it's really undescribable!.
- (Chat GPT) My method with it was to write for instance a function and then ask for feedback, a way to write clean code, and how to improve the code logically.
